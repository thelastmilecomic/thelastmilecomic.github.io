# The Last Mile
_A cross between XKCD and Dilbert, with a distinctly purple tinge._

#### What is this?
A webcomic about how it feels to work at a certain company that has lots of 'o's in its name.
Call it humor, satire, blasphemy, whatever you want.
As long as you find it entertaining enough to start laughing/crying/blushing, that's enough for me.

#### Who are you?
Nobody.

#### No, seriously, who are you?
Honestly, that's not important. If what I feel resonates with people, then I'm just expressing the
common sentiment.

#### When does the next episode come out?
Weekly on Wednesday.

#### I've got an idea for an episode, how can I contact you?
Open an issue / make a pull request. If you're too shy, send me an anonymous e-mail.

#### Why the name?
Cause I've been doing quite a few extra miles for our dear CEO, but this one is going to be my last.
